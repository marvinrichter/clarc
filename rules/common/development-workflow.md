# Development Workflow

> This file extends [common/git-workflow.md](./git-workflow.md) with the full feature development process that happens before git operations.

The Feature Implementation Workflow describes the development pipeline: research, planning, TDD, code review, and then committing to git.

## Feature Implementation Workflow

0. **Research & Reuse** _(mandatory before any new implementation)_
   - **GitHub code search first:** Run `gh search repos` and `gh search code` to find existing implementations, templates, and patterns before writing anything new.
   - **Exa MCP for research:** Use `exa-web-search` MCP during the planning phase for broader research, data ingestion, and discovering prior art.
   - **Check package registries:** Search npm, PyPI, crates.io, and other registries before writing utility code. Prefer battle-tested libraries over hand-rolled solutions.
   - **Search for adaptable implementations:** Look for open-source projects that solve 80%+ of the problem and can be forked, ported, or wrapped.
   - Prefer adopting or porting a proven approach over writing net-new code when it meets the requirement.

1. **API Contract** _(mandatory when adding or changing API endpoints or events)_
   - **Spec before code**: Write `api/v1/openapi.yaml` (REST) or `api/v1/asyncapi.yaml` (events) before any implementation
   - **Lint the spec**: `spectral lint api/v1/openapi.yaml` — must pass with zero errors
   - **Generate types/stubs**: Run code generation for affected languages (see skill `api-contract`)
   - **Breaking changes**: Any field removal, rename, or type change requires `api/v2/` — enforced by `oasdiff` in CI
   - Skip this step only for purely internal, non-API changes (e.g., refactoring, DB migrations)

2. **Plan First**
   - Use **planner** agent to create implementation plan
   - Generate planning docs before coding: PRD, architecture, system_design, tech_doc, task_list
   - Identify dependencies and risks
   - Break down into phases

3. **TDD Approach**
   - Use **tdd-guide** agent
   - Write tests first (RED)
   - Implement to pass tests (GREEN)
   - Refactor (IMPROVE)
   - Verify 80%+ coverage

4. **Code Review**
   - Use **code-reviewer** agent immediately after writing code
   - Address CRITICAL and HIGH issues
   - Fix MEDIUM issues when possible

5. **Commit & Push**
   - Detailed commit messages
   - Follow conventional commits format
   - See [git-workflow.md](./git-workflow.md) for commit message format and PR process
